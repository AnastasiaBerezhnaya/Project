GamesInc. is about to start new entertainment project “the Game of  Clans”. 
The Game of Clans is team recreational game activity where players attempt to score 
points by making a strategy to capture the enemy’s treasure. There is special large playing area.

Overall description of the system


Our system will be based on indoor positioning and involved in game process.
From the beginning all members of the team get a gadget (iOS, Android or Windows Phone), 
also they can use their own gadget to install the game app beforehand. 
With this app teams choose a Clan they will play for (application offers various choices).
Depending on their choice there will be different user interface themes. 
Game process is based on tracking the enemies on a map. 
On the map there will be several blind spots that hide players from enemies. 
Victory occurs when one or more of alive team members find a treasure of opponent team. 
More precisely the game process will be described further.
